# Robbie & the Multiverse of Madness
I made this by following along with a lesson from the ThreeJS Journey course.
The final lesson has you build a game with React Three Fiber.
I added a few small personal touches to have some fun with it.

Still new to React and Github, so apologies for anything that is off here.

You can play the game here: http://imrobbiegreen.github.io/
