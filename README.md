# Robbie & the Multiverse of Madness
I made this by following along with a lesson from the ThreeJS Journey course. The final lesson has you build a game with React Three Fiber. I added a few small personal touches to have some fun with it.

I'm not compensated in any way, but will shout praises from the rooftop for ThreeJS Journey. I dove into it in fall of 2021 as a Javascript novice with 0 experience in 3D and have learned so much from it. https://threejs-journey.com/

Still new to React and Github, so apologies for anything that is off here.

You can play the game here: http://imrobbiegreen.github.io/
